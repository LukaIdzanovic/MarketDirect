specifications. It encompasses user, system, and administrative requirements essential for the
completion of the project.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is designed for developers and designers involved in the project. It is
recommended to read the document from the beggining to gain a full understanding of the
systemâ€™s scope and requirements.

### 1.4 Product Scope
The grocery ordering system will be a platform that connects users with local stores and
supermarkets, offering an intuitive way to browse products and place orders. The system will
enhance the local economy by providing small businesses with tools for inventory

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a web application which features user-friendly interfaces for different user
types (customers, vendors, administrators).

Customers can order fresh groceries from different stores using cryptocurrency tokens for payment purposes.
Vendors control what is being offered and how much it costs, as well as a description and a
picture of the product with the ability to add or remove products. They also manage the
inventory of the online store. In addition to that, vendors have an insight into all orders.
Administrators manages vendors and can see into each vendors statistics (profit and amount
of products sold). Administrator sets the maximum allowed price for each product.

#### 2.3.3 Administrators
Administrators oversees all operations.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The web application will be hosted on a web server, accessible through a web browser.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
The web application will be written in Python using the Django framework. It
will be hosted on a web server. The data will be stored in a SQLite database.
No further design and implementation constraints are known at this time.

### 2.6 User Documentation
